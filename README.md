# Labb3
This is my solution to Labb 3. 

G.py will read datapoints from unlabelled_data.csv and with a line classify them. The points with classification will be saved as labelled_data.csv

report.ipynb looks at he same data points and classifies them with additional lines. The report also reasons regarding if one of the lines is is to be preferred.
